Stream APIs
-> it is a predefined interface available in java.util.stream interface
	- it was introduced in java8 
	- it's represent a sequence of elements that can be proccess through
	  functionally and declaratively way and allow parallel proccessing
	- it support operation like map,filter,..and so on
	- it is stream as a pipeline of data
	 
	 there are 2 type of stream 
	 1. based on data type
	 		i. reference stream
	 			it works with collections objects List, Set
	 
		 	ii. primitive stream
	 			it work on primitive type of array object to aviod autoboxing
	 					i. intStream for int values
	 					ii. LongStream for long values
	 					iii. DoubleStream for double values
	 
	 2. based on execution mode
		 	i. sequential stream
		 	- it will convert collection object into stream object for data processign
		 		that execute single thread at a time
	 	
		 	ii. parallel stream
		 	- it will convert the collection object into stream object for data
		 		proccessing that can accept multiple thread at a time
