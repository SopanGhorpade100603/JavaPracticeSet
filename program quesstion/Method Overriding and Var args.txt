Develop an application for Payment Processing by using Method Overriding and Var args 
concept.

Develop a super class Payment which contains 3 sub classes CreditCardPayment,  
DebitCardPayment and UPI.

Coding Requirements :
---------------------
Create a BLC class Payment:

Method to process a payment:

Method Name: processPayment
Access Modifier: public
Return Type: void

Task: Print a generic payment processing message (e.g., "Processing payment").


Subclass CreditCardPayment:

Override processPayment method to print a credit card-specific message:

Method Name: processPayment
Access Modifier: public
Return Type: void

Task: Print a message for credit card payment (e.g., "Processing credit card payment").

Subclass DebitCardPayment:

Override processPayment method to print a debit card specific message:

Method Name: processPayment
Access Modifier: public
Return Type: void
 
Task: Print a message for Debit card payment (e.g., "Processing Debit Card payment").


Subclass UPIPayment:

Override processPayment method to print a UPI Payment-specific message:

Method Name: processPayment
Access Modifier: public
Return Type: void

Task: Print a message for UPI payment (e.g., "Processing UPI payment").


Create an ELC class PaymentProcessing in which take main method and take another
static method

Method :

Method to process multiple payments in a single transaction:

Method Name: paymentGateway()
Access Modifier: public
Return Type: void
Arguments: Payment... payments

Task: Loop through each payment and call the processPayment method.

Create instances of CreditCardPayment, DebitCardPayment, and UPIPayment.
Use polymorphism to call the processPayment method on each instance.
