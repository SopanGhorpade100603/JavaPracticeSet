WAP in java to print odd and even numbers from 1-100 by using extends Thread class approach :
  a) Main thread should print all the even numbers
  b) Thread-0 (Child Thread) should print all the odd numbers

  Note : First It should print all the odd numbers then only even numbers

Re-Write the above program where even and odd numbers printing should be done by two different child threads (class name is EvenThread and OddThread, both are extending from Thread class). Here first of all even number should be printed then only odd numbers.
