5. Which of the following allows fast random access to elements?
	a) ArrayList,Vector

6. Which of the following implements the List Interface?
	a) ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack

7. Which of the following allows one null key? 
       	a) HashMap,LinkedHashMap

8. Which operation in Stack follows LIFO order? 
	a) Insertion and Deletion

9. How does HashMap handle collisions internally?
	a) Separate Chaining (LinkedList or Tree)

10. What happens when the number of entries in a HashMap exceeds load factor * capacity?
	a) It resizes (doubles) its capacity

11. If two different keys have the same hashcode, this situation is called:
	a) Hash-Collision

	a) push()

13. Which of the following allows null elements?
        a) ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack, HashSet, LinkedHashSet
	
14. Which class maintains insertion order of entries?
   	a) LinkedHashMap

15. HashMap internally uses a: 
	a) Array of LinkedList / Tree (since Java 8)

16. What is the default load factor of HashMap?	  d) 0.75
	
17. Time complexity of get() and put() in HashMap is:
	a) O(1) average, O(n) worst-case

18. Which method returns the value associated with a key?
	a) get(Object key)	

19. Which order does HashMap maintain for keys and values?
	a) Random order (no guarantee)		

20. Which data structure is used internally by ArrayList?
	a) Dynamic Array (Object[] array)		

21. Which of these classes can store heterogeneous data types?	
        a) ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, HashMap, etc.,		

22. Which is true about LinkedList?
	a)LinkedList maintains insertion order, allows null and duplicate elements, and is implemented as a doubly linked list.		

23. The default capacity of an ArrayList when created using default constructor is:
	a) 10		

24. The main advantage of LinkedList over ArrayList is:
	a) Efficient insertions and deletions

	a) Tree (Red-Black Tree)		

27. Which of the following implements the Map interface?
	a) HashMap		

28. What happens when ArrayList exceeds its capacity?
	a) new, larger internal array is created, and all elements are copied into it.		

29. Which of the following is the root interface of the Java Collections Framework?
	a) Iterable		

30. Which method inserts a key-value pair in HashMap?
	a) put()
