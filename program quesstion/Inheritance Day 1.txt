ZooManagement

In a virtual zoo management system, you need to organize and categorize various types of animals to efficiently manage their characteristics and behaviors. 

To achieve this, you decide to implement a class hierarchy using multilevel inheritance.

1. Create the Animal Class
Requirements:
Define a private String attribute named name.
Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize name.
Implement getter and setter methods for name.


2. Create the Mammal Class
Requirements:
Extend the Animal class.
Add a private boolean attribute named hasFur.
Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize name (from Animal) and hasFur.
Implement getter and setter methods for hasFur.


3. Create the Dog Class
Requirements:
Extend the Mammal class.
Add a private String attribute named breed.
Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize name, hasFur (from Mammal), and breed.
Implement getter and setter methods for breed.
Generate toString() method to display all the Animal Details.In this method display all the Animal Details.

4. Create the Main Class which is an ELC class.

Create an instance of the Dog class.
Display details of the Dog object to demonstrate inheritance.

TEST CASE 1 :
-------------
sample input : Dog dog = new Dog("Tommy", true, "Bulldog");
               
sample output : 
              Dog [getName()=Tommy, isHasFur()=true, breed=Bulldog]


Test case 1:-
------------------
Choose the type of object to create:
1. Animal
2. Mammal
3. Dog
Enter your choice: 1
Enter Animal Name: Lion

Expected output:-
------------------
Animal [getName()=Lion]


Test case 2:-
------------------

Choose the type of object to create:
1. Animal
2. Mammal
3. Dog
Enter your choice: 2
Enter Mammal Name: Gorila
Does the Mammal have fur? (true/false): false


Expected output:-
------------------

Mammal [getName()=Gorila, isHasFur()=false]

Test case 3:-
------------------
Choose the type of object to create:
1. Animal
2. Mammal
3. Dog
Enter your choice: 2
Enter Mammal Name: Lion
Does the Mammal have fur? (true/false): true

Expected output:-
------------------
Mammal [getName()=Lion, isHasFur()=true]


Test case 4:-
------------------
Choose the type of object to create:
1. Animal
2. Mammal
3. Dog
Enter your choice: 3
Enter Dog Name: Tommy
Does the Dog have fur? (true/false): false
Enter Dog Breed: Labrador


Expected output:-
------------------

Dog [getName()=Tommy, isHasFur()=false, breed=Labrador]



Test case 5:-
------------------
Choose the type of object to create:
1. Animal
2. Mammal
3. Dog
Enter your choice: 4

Expected output:-
------------------
Invalid choice.
Sample Input
1
Lion
Sample Output
Animal [getName()=Lion]

MultilevelInheritance
Simple Inheritance Program :
-------------------------------------
Develop one program on Multi-level Inheritance with following requirements :

Animal => Mammal => Dog [Multi-level Inheritance]

Create a BLC class called Animal.

Attributes/Properties: No properties

Constructor:
No Constructor 

Methods:

public void eat() : Method to print that "Animal is eating"

Create Another BLC class Mammal which is the sub class of Animal.

Attributes/Properties: No properties

Constructor:
No Constructor 

Methods:

public void walk() : Method to print that "Mammal is walking"


Create Another class Dog which is the sub class of Mammal.

Attributes/Properties: No properties

Constructor:
No Constructor 

Methods:

public void bark() : Method to print that "Dog is barking"


Create an ELC class MultilevelInheritance which contains main method, Create the Object for more specialized class and call the behavior.
take choice form user using scanner class and perform the below operations.

if choice is 1 create object of Animal class and call the method.
if choice is 2 create object of Mammal class and call the method.
if choice is 3 create object of Dog class and call the method.


Testcase 1:-
----------------

Choose an action:
1. Animal eats
2. Mammal walks
3. Dog barks
Enter your choice (1-3): 1

Expected Output :-
------------------

Animal is eating

Testcase 2:-
----------------

Choose an action:
1. Animal eats
2. Mammal walks
3. Dog barks
Enter your choice (1-3): 2

Expected Output :-
------------------

___________________________

Testcase 3:-
------------------
Choose an action:
1. Animal eats
2. Mammal walks
3. Dog barks
Enter your choice (1-3): 3

Expected Output :-
------------------

___________________________

Testcase 4:-
------------------
Choose an action:
1. Animal eats
2. Mammal walks
3. Dog barks
Enter your choice (1-3): 4
Sample Input
