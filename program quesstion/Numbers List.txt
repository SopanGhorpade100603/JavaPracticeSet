Mock Test Number Programs :
-------------------------------------------------
1. Prime number
[ A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]
=====================================================================================

2. Palindrome number
[A palindrome number is a number that reads the same forwards and backward. In other words, its reverse is identical to the original number.
Examples: 121, 55, 1331, 7, 9009, 12321, etc.]
====================================================================================
3. Armstrong number
[An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Examples:

153: (Number of digits = 3) 1^3 + 5^3 +3^3 = 1+125+27=153
9474: (Number of digits = 4) 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4  = 6561+256+2401+256=9474
=====================================================================================
4. Factorial of a number
The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
By definition, 0! = 1.

Examples:

0! = 1
1! = 1
2! = 2 * 1 = 2
3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
=====================================================================================
5. Fibonacci series
The Fibonacci series (or sequence) is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

How to generate:
Start with the first two numbers (0 and 1).
The next number is the sum of the previous two.
====================================================================================
6. Reverse a number
Reversing a number means creating a new number by writing its digits in reverse order.

Examples:
Reverse of 123 is 321
Reverse of 500 is 5
Reverse of 9876 is 6789
====================================================================================
7. Strong number
A strong number is a number whose sum of the factorials of its individual digits is equal to the original number.
Examples:
1: 1!=1
2: 2!=2
145: 1!+4!+5!=1+(4×3×2×1)+(5×4×3×2×1)=1+24+120=145
=====================================================================================
8. Count the digits of a given number
Counting the digits of a number means determining how many individual numerals make up the number.

Examples:
Digits in 12345: 5
Digits in 7: 1
Digits in 900: 3
==============================================================================
9. Sum of divisors
The sum of divisors of a positive integer n is the total of all its positive integers that divide n evenly (including 1 and n itself).

Examples:
Divisors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6. Sum = 1+2+3+6=12
Divisors of 7: 1, 7. Sum = 1+7=8
Divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10. Sum = 1+2+5+10=18
================================================================================
10. Add until one digit
 "Add until one digit" refers to the process of repeatedly summing the digits of a number until a single-digit result is obtained. This single-digit result is also known as the digital root of the number.

Examples:

For 123:1+2+3=6 (Result is a single digit, so 6)
For 456:4+5+6=151+5=6 (Result is a single digit, so 6)
For 999:9+9+9=272+7=9 (Result is a single digit, so 9)
================================================================================
11. Perfect number
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors (i.e., its positive divisors excluding the number itself).

Examples:
-> 6: The proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3. 1+2+3=6. So, 6 is a perfect number.
-> 28: The proper divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. 1+2+4+7+14=28. So, 28 is a perfect number.
-> 496: The proper divisors of 496 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124, 248. 1+2+4+8+16+31+62+124+248=496. So, 496 is a perfect number.
